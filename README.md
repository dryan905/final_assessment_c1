Project Details:

This project is a simple application that performs statistical analytics
on a dataset

The project contains two files: stats.c and stats.h

stats.c contains functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char
data items. These functions find the maximum, minimum, mean and median of the 
dataset. Other funstions in this program are used to print the results 
from the statistical analyics and the unsigned char array to the screen. 
Also there is a function used to reorder/sort the data in the array. This 
function will place the largest value at the head of the array and put the 
smallest value at the end of the array. In order to evaluate these functions,
an unsigned char array is created. This array contains 40 elements. 

stats.h contains the function declarations and descriptions 
for the functions used in stats.c.
